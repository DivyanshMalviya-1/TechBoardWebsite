                    The start of this tenure too seemed as bleak as last, with the second wave still raging on and another online semester on the horizon, we decided a quizzing event was due to liven everyoneâ€™s evenings, which lead to colligere - weekends full of quizzes based on a myriad of topics to satisfy one and all ranging from Football to memes. All in all we had 13 quizzes hosted on our facebook group involving a lot of fast typing, furious refreshing of the web page and lightning fast answers.
